# WineShopDB

The project requierments were as follows:
*	Create relational  DB of your choice with minimum 5 tables
*	Set Primary and Foreign Key constraints to create relations between the tables
*	Using any type of the joins create a view that combines multiple tables in a logical way
*	In your database, create a stored function that can be applied to a query in your DB
*	Prepare an example query with a subquery to demonstrate how to extract data from your DB for analysis 
*	Create DB diagram where all table relations are shown

I have uploaded the full code with comments of the working and thought process, with all the mistakes and how they were resolved.

We had to make the project as a part of a team. We had weekly meetings where we divided the work as to who will be making which databases, and on the next meeting I would put everything inyo my SQL Workbench.<br>
We worked out the issues as we went along.
